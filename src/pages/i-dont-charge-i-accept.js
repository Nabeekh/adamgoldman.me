So you want to give back? How awesome are you!

**All my content is**, and always will be, **100% free and open sourced**. FOREVER.

**I still need to eat tho**, so for my time I do accept something in return, but I don't charge for it.

Once you get immense value from our time together, **u decide** if and **how much you'd love to give**. I don't want to hold you hostage ahead of time.

*"But Adam, aren't you afraid people will take advantage of you?"*

First of all, I ain't afraid of anything ;)

So far no one has "taken advantage". **Some give less, some give more**, some really can't spare a dime so they work more passionately to refer me future clients.

One lady came to me after 30 years of therapy, twice a week, $30 each session.

That's a LOT of time and money she spent for NOT solving her problem.

[We did more progress in 2 hours than the previous 30 years combined](/blog/rachel-turns-family-trauma-to-parody).

You can imagine she was more than happy to give back ...

That's perfectly fine, there are many ways you can contribute!

[Share](FB_SHARE) this page, [leave a review](https://www.facebook.com/adamgoldman.me/reviews/) (and like!), tell your friends, and [let me know](/lets-talk/) what skills do you have that might be useful. There are many areas I could use help in order to reach more people and refine everything that I do. I appreciate every act of kindness! :)
