good
now
here's what I want you to do
in a moment I'm gonna ask u
to take a deep breath,
close your eyes and
pull the feeling out of your body
just for a brief moment
and reverse it
so it spins in the opposite direction
and change the color to a color you like better
and add some sparkles if you like
and pull it back in
so everything is in reverse
and it starts at the end and runs it's
way to the beginning

i.e. if before is started in stomach and moved upwards
to chest, now reverse it so it starts in chest
and move it downwards to stomach, watch the color
change to your liking, and feel the sparkles

Now take a deep breath,
close your eyes,
and do it now

wonderful, as you spin it faster and faster in the new direction,
and allow the new color to spread, notice if there's
anything still left from the old feeling of ${badFeeling},
and how much better do you feel now?

How interesting you can
learn to learn to turn around
your feelings as well as fast
into something new
(dare I say exciting/intruging?)
just like that, by playing with
colors and sensations?

by now you might realize you can begin to imagine what
it is that's more in your body you did not explore yet
u will be surprised how much more is yet to come as
u open to more and more possibilties now...
